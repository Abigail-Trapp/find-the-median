# find-the-median
This function sorts an array from smallest number to largest number. It then outputs the median number of the array, or the most-centered number between the smallest and largest number. If the array length is an odd number, it takes the two most adjacent numbers to the median, adds them together, and divides them by two to calculate a new average median.
